					<p class="about-me">
						I currently work for a multi-faceted technology and repair company. The operation varies from physical stores and work- shops to one of the UK’s largest online stores for technology, spares, and refurbished goods whilst catering to both B2B and B2C customers.
						I have been lucky in my career so far, in that I have been able to see how different types of organisations function and develop my skill-set accordingly.
						I have worked with all levels of staff from CEOs, Directors and Senior Management teams, right down to the ‘Shop floor’. From within a small family operation to a large multinational business.
						I am a confident individual, willing to take on all types of tasks, develop new skills and welcome new challenges. I am looking to work for a company that embraces new ideas, and I can develop
						new skills and grow my career further.
