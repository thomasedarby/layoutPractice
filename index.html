					<p class="about-me">
						I currently work for a multi-faceted technology and repair company. The operation varies from physical stores and workshops to one of the UK’s largest online stores for technology, spares, and refurbished goods whilst catering to both B2B and B2C customers.
						I have been lucky in my career so far, in that I have been able to see how different types of organisations function and develop my skill-set accordingly.
						I have worked with all levels of staff from CEOs, Directors and Senior Management teams, right down to the ‘Shop floor’. From within a small family operation to a large multinational business.
						I am a confident individual, willing to take on all types of tasks, develop new skills and welcome new challenges. I am looking to work for a company that embraces new ideas, and I can develop
						new skills and grow my career further.
